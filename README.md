# Stimulus Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot made for Stimulus, a business consulting company. It helps answer common questions like:

- What is Stimulus?
- How do I contact them?
- What services do they offer?

The chatbot is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes:

- Typing indicator (animated dots)
- Quick reply buttons
- Follow-up responses based on what users ask
- Basic keyword matching for answers

## How It Works

- You type a message or click a suggested question.
- The bot gives a helpful reply.
- It might ask a follow-up question.
- If you say “yes” or “no,” it responds again.

---

## Challenges Faced

- Making the bot understand different ways of asking the same question.
- Creating follow-up messages that feel natural.
- Making sure buttons and links work properly.

## Future Improvements

- Add smarter responses using AI tools like Dialogflow.
- Save chat history.
- Handle more complex questions.
